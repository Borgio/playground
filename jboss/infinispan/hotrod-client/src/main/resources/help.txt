ic - Infinispan Client

A simple command line client that connects to a remote cache over the HotRod protocol and
allows for simple cache operations, in a command line loop.

Commands:

    connect [initial-host:hotrod-port:[cache-name]]

        Connects the client to a HotRod server, optionally specifying a cache name. For a JDG
        server, the host:port pair is associated with a specific hotrod connector, and the hotrod
        connector is associated with a specific cache container; it is that cache container the
        client gets access to. This association is described in the JDG server's configuration file.

        If no cache name is specified, the default cache of the cache container is used. If a name
        of a cache that does not exist is used, the client will display an error message.
