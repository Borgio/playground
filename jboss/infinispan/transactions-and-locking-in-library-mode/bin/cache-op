Usage:

    put|get|lock [options] <node-index> <key> [value]

The node index is 1-based.

By default, all cache operations are executed within a JTA transaction. To disable this behavior
and execute operations in a non-transactional context, use --non-transactional option (see below).

Options:

    -s <sleep-in-seconds> - sleeps after some cache operations. By default, there is no sleep,
      the JTA transaction is committed as soon as the cache operation completes. This could be
      useful to experiment with timeouts, and more importantly, to slow down the system so humans
      could interact with it from command line.

    --non-transactional - executes the cache operation in a non-transactional context. By default
      all cache operations are executed within a JTA transaction.
