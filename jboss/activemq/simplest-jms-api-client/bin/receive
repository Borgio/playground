Usage:

    ./bin/receive \\
     --jndi 127.0.0.1:4447 \\
     --destination /queue/novaordis \\
     --connection-factory /jms/RemoteConnectionFactory \\
     [--username jmsuser --password jmsuser123] \\
     [--stats]

The client listens for incoming messages and dumps them at stdout as they arrive or displays
statistics if the "--stats" option was used.

If no --username (and corresponding --password) options are specified, the JMS Connections will be
created anonymously. The server may or may not allow anonymous connections, depending on its
security settings.
