Consistent hashing simulation.

Commands:

    info - displays the topology of the simulation.

    nodes - displays the current nodes

    write <key> <value> - writes the key/value pair directly into the appropriate node.

    read <key> - reads the key from the appropriate node. Reports null if no such key.

    add [hash-wheel-location] - simulate adding a new storage node. Optionally, a hash
        wheel location can be specified, so the new node will be added in that exact
        location in the hash wheel. If no location is specified, the node will be added
        in a random location on the hash wheel.

    exit - stops and discards the simulation.

    help - this help.
