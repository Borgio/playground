# EJB Remote Invocations over REST

An example of how an EJB application can be converted to make remote invocations over a 
REST layer, instead of its native EJB/Remoting transport. The "ejb-native" project contains
the original EJB application that uses native remote invocations. The "ejb-over-rest" 
contains the converted application.
