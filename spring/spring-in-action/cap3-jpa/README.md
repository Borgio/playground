# Spring Data JPA with H2 and PostgreSQL Support

# Overview

The example work with both H2 and PostgreSQL. For PostgreSQL, an external instance
should be available externally. [This is how you do this with Docker](https://kb.novaordis.com/index.php/PostgreSQL_with_Docker).

To switch from a database to another, comment/uncomment the corresponding properties in 
[application.properties](./src/main/resources/application.properties).
