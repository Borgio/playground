ic - Infinispan Client

A simple command line client that connects to a remote cache over the HotRod protocol and
allows for simple cache operations, in a command line loop.

Commands:

    connect [initial-host:hotrod-port] [--cache=<cache-name>]

        Connects the client to a HotRod server, optionally specifying a cache name. If no
        cache name is specified, the default cache is used. If a name of a cache that does
        not exist is used, the client will display an error message.
